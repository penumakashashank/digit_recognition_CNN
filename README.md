📘 Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN
This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits (0–9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark for image classification tasks. The implementation is done in Python using TensorFlow and Keras within Google Colab.

🔍 Overview
Load and preprocess the MNIST digit dataset.

Build and train a CNN model to classify digits.

Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Visualize results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

📊 Output Highlights
Test Accuracy: ~98%

Confusion Matrix (visualized using coolwarm color map)

Detailed classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score

🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository or download the .ipynb file.

Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Run all cells sequentially.

The model will train and evaluate performance on test data.
